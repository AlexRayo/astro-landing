          Now, let's dive into <b class="font-semibold">our story</b>. Jessica
          discovered <b class="font-semibold">Birria Bombs</b>, but alas, they
          were often sold out or available on inconvenient days. Fueled by
          determination and inspiration, she sought the guidance of her culinary
          maestra, Sara, to create her own Birria Bomb. This collaboration
          resulted in a burst of flavors and a touch of nostalgia . What began
          as a delightful kitchen experiment swiftly transformed into a tasty
          sensation cherished by our closest friends and family, who can't get
          enough.
